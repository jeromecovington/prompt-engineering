# Node.js Prompt Engineering Examples

Node.js port of the Python examples in the DeepLearning.AI course:
[ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng).

Some of the code in this repo was "dogfooded" by asking ChatGPT to port the
relevant Python example to Node.js, followed by manually cleaning up and
correcting the result.
